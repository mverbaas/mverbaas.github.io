Some, hopefully, nice words from the people I worked with.

***
Mark Verbaas is a great example of a well-structured mind. 
He has expert-level hard skills in products like SQL Server, Azure SQL, and Azure DevOps.
However, his true power reveals in the exceptional ability to turn chaos into order, applying standards, conventions, and best practices to any area where the team has to focus with.
Mark is an honest, cooperative, and hard-working professional on which I always could rely and with whom I would be glad to work again.

Kind regards,
