Yesterday I took and passed Exam DP-900: Microsoft Azure Data Fundamentals.

This certication is the first one in hopefully a series of new certifications, as I've started a learning path with my [employer][1].

## DP-900

According to [Microsoft][2], the following are the skills measured:

- Describe core data concepts (25-30%)
- Identify considerations for relational data on Azure (20-25%)
- Describe considerations for working with non-relational data on Azure (15-20%)
- Describe an analytics workload on Azure (25-30%)

Being a more old skool DBA with mostly relation database, or more specifically SQL Server, knowledge and experience, I was not completely confident about the topics that are not part of it. So my learnings for this exams basically were the other parts:

- Azure storage
  - Blob storage
  - File storage
  - Queue storage
  - Table storage
- Azure Cosmos DB
  - Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL
  - Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB
  - Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Cassandra
  - Azure Cosmos DB for Apache Gremlin
  - Azure Cosmos DB for Table
- The analytics parts
  - Azure Data Factory
  - Azure HDInsigth
  - Azure Synapse Analytics

Because I never really paid a lot of attention to these topics above, I learned quite a lot of things. Although the topics for the exam only touch the basics of these topics.

## Tools

As I mentioned earlier this exam is part of a track which is offered by my [employer][1], this also opened some new tools for me:

- A Cloud Guru
- Free exam training

Further more, I just used the Microsoft Learn paths that are offered on the [exam page][3]

## What's Next?

Next up is the [DP-203 Exam][3]. Going through the site this will really pull me out of my comfort zone and away from SQL Server. This has excited and scared at the same time. Hopefully you can read a similar post as this in the near future.
