Today I passed the [Exam DP-300: Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-300) to become an ["Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/).

In this post I want to share the resources that benefitted me in helping me achieve this certification.

## Microsoft Learn

I did all the recommended learning paths that are referenced by exam page. Most specifically the [Azure Fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals/). In the learning path you can go through all the concepts of Azure SQL family of products at your own pace. But also the other recommended paths (at the time):

- [Plan and implement data platform resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/plan-implement-data-platform-resources/)
- [Implement a secure environment for a database service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/implement-secure-environment-database-service/)
- [Monitor and optimize operational resources in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/monitor-optimize-operational-resources-sql-server/)
- [Optimize query performance in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/optimize-query-performance-sql-server/)
- [Automate tasks in SQL Server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/automate-tasks-sql-server/)
- [Plan and implement a high availability and disaster recovery environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/plan-implement-high-availability-disaster-recovery-environment/)

## YouTube

I also watched the complete [Azure SQL for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EZ3A8mHh0y0EVZoKGljNPytdjrxXIZ9) playlist. This is the equivalent of the learning path, only presented by [Anna Hoffman](https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna) and [Bob Ward](https://twitter.com/bobwardms). Together they present the topics in easy to digist method.

The [Data Exposes](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHieV7Jls72yFPSKyGqycbZR) series is also a good resource to get a better understanding of most of the features that are available in Azure SQL family of products and that are added over time. This is more a general resource, instead of a specific one for the certification.

## Bob Wards Azure SQL book

Another valuable resource is Bob Wards book, [Azure SQL Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/Azure-SQL-Revealed-Server-Professionals-ebook/dp/B08MBX5X99/ref=pd_sim_3?pd_rd_w=AyOZw&pf_rd_p=dc435707-6f1f-492e-b80d-8408db56abc9&pf_rd_r=FDZJZS72JESSCRA2GHCQ&pd_rd_r=c5c64203-a243-45f0-bb23-685db66efa46&pd_rd_wg=VAN18&pd_rd_i=B08MBX5X99&psc=1). In the book Bob Ward takes the reader with him in his journey from his years of supporting on-premises SQL servers to the Azure cloud.

## General

I think these three resources, and some form of practical experience using SQL server will help you become an "Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate" too.
