# Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate

Today I passed the [Exam DP-300: Administering Relational Databases on Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/dp-300) to become an ["Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-database-administrator-associate/).

In this post I want to share the resources that benefitted me in helping me achieve the certifications.

## Microsoft Learn

I did all the recommended learning paths that are referenced by exam page. Most specifically the [Azure Fundamentals learning path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-sql-fundamentals/). In the learning path you can go through all the concepts of Azure SQL family of products at your own pace.

## YouTube

I also watched the complete [Azure SQL for beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3EZ3A8mHh0y0EVZoKGljNPytdjrxXIZ9) playlist. This is the equivalent of the learning path, only presented by [Anna Hoffman](https://twitter.com/AnalyticAnna) and [Bob Ward](https://twitter.com/bobwardms). Together they present the topics in easy to digist method. 

## Bob Wards Azure SQL book

Another valuable resource is Bob Wards book, [Azure SQL Revealed](https://www.amazon.com/Azure-SQL-Revealed-Server-Professionals-ebook/dp/B08MBX5X99/ref=pd_sim_3?pd_rd_w=AyOZw&pf_rd_p=dc435707-6f1f-492e-b80d-8408db56abc9&pf_rd_r=FDZJZS72JESSCRA2GHCQ&pd_rd_r=c5c64203-a243-45f0-bb23-685db66efa46&pd_rd_wg=VAN18&pd_rd_i=B08MBX5X99&psc=1). In the book Bob Ward takes the reader with him in his journey from his years of supporting on-premises SQL servers to the Azure cloud.

## General

Personally I thing these three, and some form of practical experience using SQL server will help you become an "Microsoft Certified: Azure Database Administrator Associate" too.
